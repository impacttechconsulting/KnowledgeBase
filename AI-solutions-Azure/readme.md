## Develop generative AI solutions in Azure

## Exercises

** Prepare for an AI development project **
Learn how to organize cloud resources in Microsoft Foundry projects so that developers are set up for success when building AI solutions.

Choose and deploy a language model
Generative AI applications are built on one or more language models. Learn how to find and select appropriate models for your generative AI project.

Create a generative AI chat app
Learn how to use the Microsoft Foundry SDK to build an app that connects to your project and chats with a language model.

Use a prompt flow to manage conversation in a chat app
Learn how to use prompt flows to manage conversational dialogs and ensure that prompts are constructed and orchestrated for best results.

Create a generative AI app that uses your own data
Learn how to use the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model to build a chat app that grounds prompts using your own data.

Fine-tune a language model
Learn how to use your own training data to fine-tune a model and customize its behavior.

Apply content filters to prevent the output of harmful content
Learn how to apply content filters that mitigate potentially offensive or harmful output in your generative AI app.

Evaluate generative AI model performance
Learn how to evaluate models and prompts to optimize the performance of your chat app and its ability to respond appropriately.
